        You are accessing a wallet with 12-word mnemonic passphrase. These are not longer supported thus you
        won't be able to use the Shelley features. Depending on which wallet did you use before, we may not
        even show your whole balance (this applies especially for Daedalus wallet users) so if you dont see
        your whole balance, please use Deadealus. We strongly advise you to immediately transfer all funds
        from this wallet to a new Shelley compatible wallet.
